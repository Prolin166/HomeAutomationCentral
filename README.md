# HomeAutomationCentral
HomeAutomationCentral is a software to bring different technologies together in one app. In my case I wanted to my homeautomation with the philips hue bridge togther with my own automation based on esp controller. To use the HomeAutomationCentral, there is a REST-API which can be called from different ui technologies.
